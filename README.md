# Steppy
Pattern based step sequencer with very little features

## Install
```
$ git clone https://github.com/t638403/steppy.git
```
## Run
```
$ cd steppy
$ electron .
```

## How it works
The GUI operates on a song object. Every T3 module renders a part of the song object. The song object is going to be
used by a service wich will generate midi messages en then you will hear your devices play.

## TODO
Make it work. It cannot play anything yet. It is just the GUI.
